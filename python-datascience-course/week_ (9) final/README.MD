# Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to make students proficient in working with the GitHub API, extracting data, and performing data analysis. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to:

Use the GitHub API to extract PR commit data from a repository.
Analyze and visualize the data using suitable tools and techniques.
Interpret the results and draw conclusions from their analysis.
Assignment Brief:

Your task is to analyze a GitHub repository of your choice. You will need to extract commit data from the repository, clean and process the data, analyze it, and then interpret your findings. The purpose of this assignment is not only to demonstrate your skills in using APIs and performing data analysis but also to showcase your ability to interpret and present data in a meaningful way.

# Tasks:

Choose a GitHub repository: Choose a GitHub repository that is active and interesting for you. It should have a substantial number of commits for meaningful analysis.

Data Extraction: Use the GitHub API to extract the commit data from your chosen repository. Your extracted data should include the following details at a minimum: commit ID, commit message, author name, author email, date of commit, and the files changed in each commit.

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Clean and process the extracted data. Remove any irrelevant or unnecessary information. Organize the data in a manner suitable for analysis.

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data. Some potential questions you could explore are: who are the most active contributors, what is the frequency of commits, what are the most common words in commit messages, what files are most frequently changed, etc.

- **Data Visualization**: Use suitable data visualization techniques to present your findings. Charts, graphs, heatmaps etc. can be used.

- **Interpretation & Conclusion**: Based on your analysis, interpret your findings and draw conclusions.

- **Report Writing**: Write a report detailing your methodology, findings, and conclusions. Include visualizations and references where appropriate.

## Deliverables:

Python/Jupyter notebook or equivalent containing your code. You can use examples [here](boilerplate/main.py) from the course as a starting point.

Cleaned and processed data file.

Report (in Notion) presents your findings and conclusions.
